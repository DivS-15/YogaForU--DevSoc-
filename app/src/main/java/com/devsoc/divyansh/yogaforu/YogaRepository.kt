        "The body comes into a V-shape, balancing entirely on the buttocks. In different variations and traditions, the arms, legs and torso may take different positions. In Paripurna Navasana, the legs and back are lifted high and arms extend forward and parallel to the ground. In Ardha Navasana, hands interlace behind the neck and both back and shoulders are closer to the ground.",
        "From a prone position, the feet are grasped to lift the legs and chest to form the shape of a bow with the body, the arms representing the bowstring.",
        "The palms are placed under the shoulders, pushing down until the hips lift slightly. The backs of the feet rest on the ground, the legs outstretched; the gaze is directed forwards, giving the preparatory pose. For the full pose, the back is arched until the arms are straight, and the gaze is directed straight upwards or a little backwards. The legs remain on the ground, unlike in the similar Upward Dog pose",
        "One foot is placed flat on the floor outside the opposite leg and torso twists toward the top leg. The bottom leg may be bent with the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically. The arms help leverage the torso into the twist and may be bound (Baddha Ardha Matsyendrasana) in a number of configurations by clutching either feet or opposite hands."
